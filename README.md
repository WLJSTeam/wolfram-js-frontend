## Highlights

### Feels like Mathematica and Jupyter
WLJS Notebook feels and works like Wolfram Mathematica (and it can open .nb files) and has a flat and minimal notebook structure like in Jupyter Lab.

### Interactive & Powerful
Optimized for interactive computing and allows to make complex real-time visualizations. From the high-level `Manipulate` to low-level graphics primitives

### Super portable
Export and share your notebook as a standalone or embeddable .html or .mdx file—plots stay interactive, and sliders remain draggable.

### Batteries included
More than 200 importers/exporters formats, 3000 functions. Vast standard library of Wolfram Engine is ready for every computational need.

### Javascript Sandbox
First class support of Javascript cells with a dedicated communication channel to Wolfram Kernel. Use any library from web to enhance your visuals.

### Crossplatform
Windows, GNU/Linux, MacOS or even a browser. We carefully designed the backend and adjusted our UI to match all platforms

### Works fully offline
No needs in the internet connection, no dependencies on external services. Yours forever

### LLM agent included 
An optional AI-assistant will see directly, edit, evalaute any cell in the notebook
