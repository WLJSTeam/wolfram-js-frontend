:::

The library is divided into separate sections based on topics and categorized by audience type, showcasing the functionality of Wolfram Language and WLJS.

In each section, we divide tutorials and examples into subcategories based on difficulty level and/or required skills:

- **A** - Suitable for beginners
- **B** - Requires basic knowledge of Wolfram Language
- **C** - Confident level of WLJS and Wolfram Language
- **D** - Deep dive, requires programming skills, possibly knowledge of HTML and JavaScript
- **E** - Climbing a Celeste Mountain

## Full List of Topics

### Introduction
We encourage you to start with *Introduction to WLJS* and then pick a topic of interest. *You do not have to be a Mathematica user to work with a WLJS Notebook.* This project is aimed at a broad audience, including scientists, analysts, and programmers.

If you are new to Wolfram Language, please, jump on *An Elementary Introduction to Wolfram Language* written by Stephen Wolfram.

- **Introduction to WLJS** - a brief overview of notebook interface and WL
- **An Elementary Introduction to Wolfram Language** - the most essential and accessible knowledge (UPD: removed due to legal issues)
- **Data Visualization** - showcases of the most essential plotting functions and charts in 2D and 3D, including path-tracing and PBR materials.
