## Guidelines

- **Do not use** `<body>` or `<head>` tags.  
  Only include `<div>` or other content-related tags.  
  The code is embedded directly into the notebook cell layout.  

- Always self-close void elements:  
  - `<img/>`  
  - `<br/>`  
  - `<input/>`  

- You may add `<script>` and `<style>` tags anywhere as needed.
