The Wolfram Language environment in **WLJS Notebook** differs slightly from Wolfram Mathematica.  
Some symbols commonly available in Mathematica are **not supported** here:

- `Dynamic`  
- `DynamicModule`  
- `Animate`  
- `Refresh`  
- `Specularity`  
- `CellPrint`  
- `EvaluationCell`  
- `Notebook`  
- `EvaluationNotebook`  
- `PlotLabel`  
- `Information`  
- `Out`  
- `Slider`  
- `Show`  

In WLJS Notebook, alternative libraries are preloaded into the kernel to provide similar functionality, though their usage may differ from the standard Mathematica approach.  

For details on replacements and workarounds, refer to the relevant library documentation.
