## Privacy Policy

**Short version:** WLJS Notebook runs locally and does not collect or transmit your data unless you explicitly choose a feature that needs the network.

### What we do **not** do
- We do **not** collect analytics or telemetry.
- We do **not** upload your notebooks, code, or data to our servers.
- We do **not** send automatic crash reports.

### When the app may use the network
WLJS Notebook is offline-first. Network access occurs **only** when you initiate features that require it, for example:
- Opening links or remote assets you add to a notebook.
- Using packages, examples, or resources hosted online that you choose to load.
- Checking for or downloading releases from GitHub (if you click to do so).
- Opening published notebooks via the `wljs-message://` URL scheme (if you click such links).

### Third-party component: Wolfram Engine
WLJS Notebook uses the **Wolfram Engine** to execute Wolfram Language code. The Wolfram Engine is developed by Wolfram Research, Inc. and **may contact Wolfram servers** for actions such as:
- Product activation and license validation (including entitlement checks).
- Downloading documentation, paclets, or other resources you request.
- Any other network activity covered by Wolfram’s own terms.

Those behaviors are governed by Wolfram’s licenses and policies, not ours. Please review:
- Wolfram Engine license and terms: https://www.wolfram.com/legal/terms/wolfram-engine.html

### Local data
- Your notebooks and settings are stored on your device or on the storage locations you choose.
- Any logs created by WLJS Notebook are written locally. You control if/when you share them for support.

### Your choices
- Keep WLJS Notebook fully offline by avoiding network-requiring features.
- Use the Wolfram Engine in an offline-licensed mode where permissible by Wolfram’s terms.
- Review and restrict your operating system’s network permissions and firewall rules.

### Questions or concerns
If you notice unexpected network activity or have privacy questions, please contact us via
